usage: %MAIN% [options]

Options:
  -h,--help         Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version      Print version and exit.
  -b,--base BASE    Base directory to work in (default .strong-pm).
  -c,--config CFG   Config file (default BASE/config).
  -l,--listen PORT  Listen on PORT for git pushes (no default).
  -C,--control CTL  Listen for local control messages on CTL (default `pmctl`).
  --no-control      Do not listen for local control messages.

The process manager will be controllable via HTTP on the port specified. That
port is also used for deployment with strong-deploy. Basic authentication
can be enabled for HTTP by setting the STRONGLOOP_PM_HTTP_AUTH environment
variable to <user>:<pass> (eg. strong-pm:super-secret). This is the same format
as used by the --http-auth option of pm-install.

It is also controllable using local domain sockets, which look like file paths,
and the listen path can be changed or disabled. These sockets do not support
HTTP authentication.
